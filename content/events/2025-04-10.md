Come join us for a discussion a mini NUG meetup at Legend Chicken.
It's the one after PlanetNix, so we'll be discussing the conference and what we learned.

After dinner, we'll go next door for karaoke at Pang Pang Karaoke.

The next full size NUG will be on May 3rd at Long Beach City College, LAC campus.
See details here [here](/events/2025-05-03).

Bring your laptop, show off your Nix configs, and ask questions.
No prior experience with Nix is required, and all are welcome.
